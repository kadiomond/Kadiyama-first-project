    Kepler Kiziba Campus is located in Western Province in Karongi District. It is found in the middle of Kiziba Refugees Camp. Kiziba is situated near the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Rwanda’s western province. Many refugees were born there and countless more will be, as the camp has been in existence for 24 years and is home to more than 17,000 Congolese refugees feeling violence and instability in the DRC.Kepler Program opened in 2015, and it increased the number of Kiziba Refugees who have attended universities.<br> <br>Now, Kiziba Refugees benefit from free United States accredited degree programme courtesy of Kepler Rwanda; a nonprofit University program opened a branch in the camp.  
Kepler is a non-governmental organization working in Rwanda since 2013, in partnership with Southern New Hampshire University. SNHU provides students in East Africa with access to accredited American degrees through their innovative competency-based online degree. The online work is paired with extensive support services provided by Kepler, which include in-person coaching, health and financial support services and career preparation. Kepler makes sure that graduates are able to apply the skills developed through the SNHU degree to meet the labor market needs in countries with developing economies.

  <h2 class="four">History Of Kepler Program In Rwanda</h2>
  <img src="https://www.chronicle.com//img/photos/biz/photo_41273_landscape_650x433.jpg" class="aba">

  <p class="six">Kepler was born out of Generation Rwanda, who enabled talented, but economically vulnerable Rwandan students to attend university and prepared them with skills needed to enter the workforce since 2004. In 2013 they got an opportunity to increase their impact through a new partnership with Southern New Hampshire University and their new College for America program.<br><br> This partnership offered a highly innovative approach combining Southern New Hampshire University’s online degree access with in-person seminars, job readiness training, and coaching. It enables students to attain affordable, internationally recognized degrees while studying in East Africa. To help students complete their American accredited BA degrees, Kepler provides loans for laptops and internet access, interactive support classes, personal advising, wrap-around student services, career support, and an inspiring and empowering learning environment.Kepler’s first cohort in 2013 consisted of 50 students and has grown 10 times with 550 students and two campuses as of September 2017. In 2015, Kepler opened a second campus in Kiziba refugee camp in western Rwanda where it serves students who are refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the same year, the Kigali campus began serving students from Burundi. In 2016, we expanded to include students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Uganda.</>
