<h1> KEPLER KIZIBA STUDENT LIFE</h1> </head> 

<body> 
  <h2> ACADEMIC LIFE</h2>

<p>SNHU’s refugee programs are unique in the humanitarian education sphere. Our higher education model for refugees is based upon a proven program that was designed for development contexts. As the number of refugees in long-term, protracted displacement situations worldwide continues to grow, it is critical that we strive to bridge the humanitarian-development gap by sharing best practices – learning from development-oriented approaches in order to find refugee-oriented solutions. In addition, our competency-based degree program is designed for maximum flexibility. Southern New Hampshire University’s online, project-based learning model means that highly mobile refugee students – often facing precarious and uncertain futures  – can complete their studies at a self-directed pace and with the guarantee that their US accredited degree will be recognized globally.
  At Kepler Kiziba Campus life is easy and some how challenged. The life is easy because students and Kiziba 
  Campus are highly supported by Kepler Kiziba Staff, and students helps each other in their daily life. For example,
   if a student is stack on a given work or assignement, he or she has the right to concern the his or her adviser 
   for that sake of being helped on what he or she stack on..

<h2>STUDENT HEALTH AT KEPLER KIZIBA</h2>
<p>Students at Kiziba are well helped by Kepler Organization in terms of sustaining their health. 
  This is done through offering different examination to their students to make sure that their students are not 
  being out of the academic performance because of their life issues. Some of the examination that are done at Kepler 
  are eye check ups, all body check up, HIV AIDS check up, and other diseases. They also help their students in terms of 
  vaccinating them all Hepatitis vaccines. When a student continues to have the life issues, Kepler fund all the student 
  requirements that will be used to make the life well of its students. For example, paying all the expenses that a student
   used in his or her journey and all the life expenses used in buying different medecines, transfer fees, and other expenses.</p>
